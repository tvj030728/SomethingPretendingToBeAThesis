## Abstract

This research systematically explores the structural isomorphism between human memory storage mechanisms and modern computer memory architecture. In particular, it presents the hypothesis that human short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) operate on similar principles as computer RAM (Random Access Memory) and secondary storage devices, respectively, validating these claims through neurological evidence and empirical data. Through fMRI studies and EEG analysis conducted on 20 subjects, we demonstrated that neural activation patterns observed during visual information processing exhibit structural and functional similarities to computer memory management systems. A particularly noteworthy finding is that the automatic deletion mechanism for unnecessary information operates similarly to a computer's garbage collection system. The results of this study are expected to deepen our understanding of human memory systems and present a new paradigm for designing more efficient artificial memory systems.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Research Background

The human brain is known as the most complex and efficient information processing system. While the design of modern computer systems began as an attempt to mimic the structure and function of the human brain, paradoxically, modern computer architecture now provides new insights into understanding how human memory systems operate.

1. Verification of structural isomorphism between human memory systems and computer memory architecture
2. Comparative analysis of information processing and storage mechanisms
3. Validation of hypotheses through neurological evidence
4. Exploration of clinical application possibilities

### 1.3 Significance of the Research

## 2. Theoretical Background

Human memory systems and computer memory architecture exhibit remarkably similar structural characteristics. These similarities are not mere coincidences but reflect fundamental optimization principles of information processing systems. This chapter provides a detailed comparative analysis of the structural characteristics of these two systems.

### 2.1 Structure of Human Memory Systems

The human memory system is a product of evolution, resulting from millions of years of natural selection. This system has evolved to optimize energy efficiency, information processing flexibility, and adaptive learning capabilities. A particularly noteworthy aspect is that the hierarchical structure of memory is optimized according to the temporal characteristics and importance of information.

#### 2.1.1 Hierarchical Structure of Memory

The human memory system, from sensory memory to long-term memory, functions as a sophisticated filtering system. Each stage has unique temporal and spatial characteristics, enabling efficient processing and storage of information.

1. Sensory Memory

   Sensory memory serves as the initial gateway for external stimuli, characterized by its capacity to store all sensory information as received. It functions similarly to a computer's input buffer, providing raw data for subsequent processing. Notably, recent neuroimaging studies have empirically verified that iconic memory (visual sensory memory) can maintain detailed visual information for approximately 250ms.

2. Short-term/Working Memory

   Short-term memory functions beyond a temporary information repository, serving as an active platform for information processing. According to Baddeley's working memory model, it consists of four main components: the phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad, central executive, and episodic buffer. This structure shows remarkable similarities to the hierarchical organization of RAM and cache memory systems in computers.

3. Long-term Memory

   Long-term memory serves as a permanent repository of information, divided into semantic and episodic memory. Recent neuroscientific research demonstrates that long-term memory is not merely a storage system but a dynamic, reconstructive system. Particularly noteworthy is that the compression and reconstruction processes of memory operate on principles similar to data compression algorithms in computers.

#### 2.1.2 Neurological Basis

Advances in modern neuroscience have enabled a deeper understanding of the biological foundations of memory systems. In particular, the interaction between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in memory formation and maintenance.

1. Hippocampal Complex

   The hippocampus plays a central role in forming new memories and transferring them to long-term memory. Recent studies show that the hippocampus is not simply a memory repository but an active center for information processing and integration. Particularly noteworthy is that long-term potentiation (LTP) observed in hippocampal neurons displays mechanisms similar to memory write operations in computers.

2. Prefrontal Cortex

   The prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in maintaining and manipulating working memory. This region functions similarly to a computer's central processing unit (CPU), regulating selective attention and processing of information. In particular, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been found to be directly related to working memory capacity limitations.

### 2.2 Structure of Computer Memory Systems

Modern computer memory systems remarkably reflect the hierarchical structure of human memory systems. This suggests that optimizing information processing systems can lead to similar structural solutions.

#### 2.2.1 Memory Hierarchy

The memory hierarchy of computers has evolved to optimize the trade-off between speed and capacity. Each layer has specific temporal and spatial characteristics, maximizing the efficiency of the entire system.

1. Registers

   Registers are ultra-high-speed memory located within the CPU, storing data and instructions currently being processed. They exhibit characteristics similar to human immediate attention systems. Particularly noteworthy is that register access time is less than 1 nanosecond, which is much faster than neuronal firing rates.

2. Cache Memory

   Cache memory serves as an intermediate layer compensating for speed differences between the CPU and main memory, featuring a multi-layered structure (L1, L2, L3). This hierarchical structure shows remarkable similarities to human working memory systems. In particular, the locality principle of cache operates similarly to human associative memory systems. Algorithms optimizing cache hit ratios can be compared to human predictive memory retrieval mechanisms.

3. Main Memory (RAM)

   RAM serves as the primary workspace for currently running programs and data, exhibiting characteristics most similar to human working memory. The volatility of RAM aligns with the temporary information storage characteristic of working memory. Recent studies show that RAM's dynamic allocation method operates on principles similar to human attentional resource allocation mechanisms.

4. Secondary Storage

   Secondary storage devices like hard disks or SSDs show characteristics similar to human long-term memory. Particularly noteworthy are the permanent storage and retrieval mechanisms of information. The wear-leveling algorithms of modern SSDs distribute information in a manner similar to the reconstructive characteristics of human memory.

#### 2.2.2 Memory Management Mechanisms

Memory management mechanisms in modern computer systems reflect several characteristics of human memory systems. Particularly noteworthy are the similarities in selective storage, retrieval, and deletion processes.

1. Virtual Memory

   Virtual memory systems are innovative solutions to overcome physical memory limitations. Memory management through paging systems is similar to the flexible resource allocation demonstrated by human memory systems. In particular, demand paging techniques show remarkable similarities to human need-based memory retrieval mechanisms.

2. Cache Management

   Replacement algorithms in cache management systems (e.g., LRU, LFU) are similar to the selective forgetting and retention mechanisms shown by human memory systems. In particular, maintaining cache coherence can be compared to human memory updating processes.

## 3. Research Methodology

This study employed a multi-methodological approach to empirically verify the structural isomorphism between human memory systems and computer memory architecture. In particular, advanced neuroimaging techniques and precise behavioral experiments were integrated to analyze the similarities between the two systems from multiple angles.

All participants took part in the research in a highly controlled experimental environment, and their neurophysiological and psychological states were continuously monitored throughout the experiment.
